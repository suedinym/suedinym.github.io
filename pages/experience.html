			<!-- 	<p>	<strong>Medium:</strong> Greeting Card Copy</p>
				<p>	<strong>Involvement:</strong> Wrote the copy for the card - except my version featured a cat, rather than Playdoh. (The studio illustrated it.)</p> -->
				<p>	<strong>Objective:</strong> To have fun brainstorming ideas, quickly, to get the creative juices flowing. Oatmeal Studios features quirky ideas, and submitting to them was fun.</p>
